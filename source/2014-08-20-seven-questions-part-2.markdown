This is Part 2 in a series following up on Erin Carson's [article for TechRepublic titled "How to pick a coding camp: 7 questions to ask"](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-pick-a-coding-camp-7-questions-to-ask/).

The first post in the series dealt with the question ["How Intense Is It?"](http://blog.turing.io/2014/08/12/seven-questions-part-1/). Today I'll dive into the second question...

## What Are The Camp's Motives?

This question is heavy and difficult to answer. Most every training program "talks marketing" on their site -- "we're the best", "we'll make you the best", etc.

But even in that marketing talk you can start to hear the voice of the organization. Do they focus on how "elite" they are? Obsess about salary? Talk about their community? What do they say about their alumni? Are they reaching for legitimacy or do they sound confident?

### For-Profit Education

For-profit education in the big picture is a complicated topic. Most training programs operate as for-profit businesses, which is not inherently a bad thing. Particularly in the US, there's a belief that for-profit business produce the best possible results. If their results aren't strong, then the business falls apart. If a restaurant has bad food or nasty service, it'll be closed soon.

But in education it's not so clear cut.

### The Skill Delta

Tracking the skill delta over a significant amount of time is almost impossible. If you look at the K-12 world, there are very smart people trying to figure out how to tie student growth/achievement to teacher evaluations. There is no good system or metric, yet.

If I tell you 100% of graduates from programs I've run were hired as developers, that sounds pretty good, right? But that doesn't say much about the quality of my work.

### The Superstar

In [Hungry Academy](http://hungryacademy.com) I had a phenomenal student Austen who'd been a professional Java developer for five years and has a CS degree in his pocket. I could have sat in my office doing *nothing* for that five-month program, and Austen would have *still* come out as a solid Ruby developer. His delta wouldn't be that large.

But that's not how it went down. We pushed him hard. His skills went from good to great. Once on the job he was given huge responsibilities and was able to fullfil them. Now, having moved from LivingSocial to [Kitchensurfing](https://www.kitchensurfing.com/new-york), he's a critical part of the dev team.

Austen has been a good friend and superstar mentor through all our following classes, but I don't look back and say "**nailed it**." His success was almost guaranteed.

### A Big Delta

I think about people like Mary. Before Hungry Academy, Mary was working long hours answering phones in LivingSocial's customer support. She didn't have any technical experience beyond what she needed for her job.

And in Hungry Academy, Mary struggled. She fought hard. She lost faith in her abilities then found it again. We worked to support her as best we could, but her success was *always* in jeopardy.

But she made it. She joined LivingSocial's engineering team and succeeded. She recently took a great opportunity to join the dev team at [Paperless Post](https://www.paperlesspost.com/). She's loving her work and continues to participate in our student mentoring with Turing.

### A Life Change

Most of our students go through a significant life change. I like to think about a graph of their happiness in life; we work to help them increase the slope of that curve.

Being a programmer is a solid job. If you're good at it, are nice to people, and keep working hard, you don't have to worry about having a job *ever*. It's a foundation you can build a life upon.

Think about the *delta* in that life. How much happier is someone like Mary writing code than the old days of answering phones? How much more creative are her days? How does that change her overall happiness?

We can't ignore salary. For many students their post-program salary is more than double what they earned coming in. Money itself is nice, but there's a huge life impact here.

That salary means our graduates are more likely to own a home. Relieving financial stress means they're more likely to be happy with themselves, and they're more likely to find and stick with a life partner. If they choose to have children, those kids are more likely to live in a neighborhood with strong schools. They're more likely to attend college. They're more likely to build a strong relationship with their parent who can be home in the evenings and weekends. That's multi-generational change.

### On Motives

I can't speak to other organizations' motives. You'll have to try and deduce them from a website or some chats with students/alumni.

We're using programming to change lives. We'll never turn down the Austens who show up with a CS degree and are surely going to be successful.

But that's not what gets us up in the morning. It's Mary who can put down the support phone, Darryl who can quit *both* shitty jobs, Allie who no longer bakes enough to lose the feeling in her fingers, and all the rest of our dreamers. Through a few months of intense work, they can change the trajectory of their life.

That's what we're about. [Join us](http://apply.turing.io).

This is Part 2 in a series following up on Erin Carson's [article for TechRepublic titled "How to pick a coding camp: 7 questions to ask"](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-pick-a-coding-camp-7-questions-to-ask/).

The first post in the series dealt with the question ["How Intense Is It?"](http://blog.turing.io/2014/08/12/seven-questions-part-1/). Today I'll dive into the second question...

## What Are The Camp's Motives?

For me, this is the most critical question, and by far, the hardest question to concretely answer. Each program will espouse what they deliver, what they offer, and what they profess to turn you into by the end of the program - a kickass developer. At Turing, we’re no different in that respect. We build developers. Damn good ones too. But to unearth the motives behind any program, you have to push past the marketing, and like the article advises, “…figure out why they're [coding camps] structured the way they're structured.” Find out “Who they are and why they are invested.”

If I tell you 100% of graduates from programs I've run were hired as developers, that sounds pretty good, right? But that doesn't say much about the quality of my work or more specifically, how I approach building the kind of developers that get hired right out of school. If I tell you that all of my placed graduates are making $70k+ salaries, it sounds lucrative, but doesn’t shed much light on why I’m invested in this mission and what I get out of the deal. 

The motives behind a program are important, because inherently - they have an impact on the curriculum, the experience, and at the end of the day, your success or failure on the investment you are making when you choose a particular program.

### The Skill Delta

For-profit education in the big picture is a complicated topic. Most training programs operate as for-profit businesses, which is not inherently a bad thing. Particularly in the US, there's a belief that for-profit business produce the best possible results. If their results aren't strong, then the business falls apart. If a restaurant has bad food or nasty service, it'll be closed soon.

But in education it's not so clear cut. Students come in many different styles of skill sets, learning abilities, backgrounds, interests. And those styles don’t automatically dictate success or failure. Consider the skill delta between the following two stark profiles of student types I have in every class. 

### The Superstar

In [Hungry Academy](http://hungryacademy.com) I had a phenomenal student Austen who'd been a professional Java developer for five years with a CS degree in his pocket. I could have sat in my office playing solitaire for that five-month program, and Austen would have *still* come out as a solid Ruby developer. His skill delta was not significant.

But that's not how it went down. We pushed him hard. His skills went from good to great. Once on the job he was given huge responsibilities and was able to fulfill them. Now, having moved from LivingSocial to [Kitchensurfing](https://www.kitchensurfing.com/new-york), he's a critical part of the dev team.

Austen has been a good friend and superstar mentor through all our following classes, but when I look back at that experience, I don't say "**nailed it**." To be perfectly honest, Austen’s success was guaranteed, no matter the approach our program took with him.

### The Struggler

Before Hungry Academy, Mary was working long hours answering phones in LivingSocial's customer support. She didn't have any technical experience beyond what she needed for her job.

And in Hungry Academy, Mary struggled. She fought hard. She lost faith in her abilities then found it again. We worked to support her as best we could, but her success was *always* in jeopardy.

But she made it. She joined LivingSocial's engineering team and succeeded. She recently took a great opportunity to join the dev team at [Paperless Post](https://www.paperlesspost.com/). She's loving her work and continues to participate in our student mentoring with Turing.

When I look back at that experience, I like to think about the current *delta* in her life. How much happier she is writing code than the old days of answering phones. How much more creative she is now and how that factors into her overall happiness. And we can't ignore salary, which doubled after finishing our program. Money itself is nice, but there's a huge life impact moving from less than $50K to close to or over $100K. She's more likely to own a home. Most couples point to financial stress as the number one challenge in a welationship, so by alleviating that stress she's more likely to find and stick with a person she wants to spend her life with. If she chooses to have children, those kids are more likely to live in a neighborhood with strong schools. They're more likely to attend college. They're more likely to build a strong relationship with their mom who can be home in the evenings and weekends. That's multi-generational change.

Being a programmer is a solid job. If you're good at it, are nice to people, and keep working hard, you don't have to worry about having a job *ever*. It's a foundation you can build a life upon.

And this is why I get out of the bed in the morning. To push the superstar into superstardom and to show the struggler that superstar status is attainable.

### On Motives

I’ve structured Turing in such a way as to be singularly focused on the motive of making great developers. 
- We are a non-profit, which eliminates the temptations that investors can bring to the table. That isn’t to say that for-profit organizations are bad, it is just to say that Turing’s stance on how we approach a student’s education is not for sale. 
- We hire teachers that are more than just amazing developers, we hire people who can actually teach. And then we pay them very, very well. 
- We believe in focusing on the individual student, not just an enrollment or graduation statistic. As such, we often change our approach from class to class, pending the needs of indivdual superstars, strugglers and everything in between in order to produce results that are the very best for each student. 

I can't speak to other organizations' motives. You'll have to try and deduce them from a website or some chats with students/alumni.

We're using programming to change lives. We'll never turn down the Austens who show up with a CS degree and are surely going to be successful.

But it's Mary who can put down the support phone, and Darryl who can quit *both* shitty jobs, Allie who no longer bakes enough to lose the feeling in her fingers, and all the rest of our dreamers that we are passionate about providing the kind of environment that can change the trajectory of their life.
