> *Overall, I think you need to introspect this with a little less belligerence. :) The passion is good, but let's reframe some of it. Here is an outline of ideas/bullets to illustrate what I'm proposing. Just some quick points, borrowing much of what you have, but a change in tone and adding a few others as food for thought. NOT intended verbatim of course, you would need to recraft in your voice (your nice voice) and work with the right points/organization.*

_______________________________________

  + Turing is very close to reaching it's approval as a 501(c)(3) status. This has been a long, difficult road, wrought w/ bureacacy, and an inability to qualify for things like SBA loans, which we could desperately use. And while exceptionally difficult, I believe Turing's non-profit status is the most important decision we've made for the program and our students.
  
  + As someone who bootstrapped Jumpstart Lab in 2009, doing the same with Turing made sense. It made sense, because I am in this for the education. I am passionate about cultivating the very best talent and providing a curriculum and an environment that answers only to students. I fundamentally believe the non-profit status is critical in keeping Turing focused on what's important - students instead of investors.  
  
  + I've worked in the tech world for 'xx' years as a developer and an educator for 'xx' years. Investors don't give money away, *they expect it back*. And in the tech world, they're often looking for 10x return on investment. If they put
in 18 million dollars they're shooting for a payout of 180 million.

  + If you look around you'll find developer education programs taking investments left and right, some in the tens of millions of dollars. If you're running a software or content business, that works. Khan Academy or
Coursera can parlay investment dollars into new content that can reach millions
of learners -- that's awesome. If they're each willing to pay a few dollars then
the investors can hit their 10x no problem while realizing the educational goals.

  + But classrooms don't scale in the same ways as software and content, nor should they. At Turing, we care first and foremost about the integrity of the classroom. And what that means to us is:
    - statement about student to teacher ratio
    - statement about the best and brightest and fully committed teachers 
    - statement about the application process 
    - statement about mentor program, giving back to community, etc.

  + At Turing, we choose not to bring our classroom integrity into question. We do this by keeping the group of decision makers small and removing the tempation and risk that an investor model can introduce. The most important thing I can offer to the students, the industry, and myself is to foster an ecosystem that is driven by excellence in teaching, and return on investment to students - not third parties. 
  + We charge a healthy and competitive tuition, and 100% of it is funneled back into the system for students. This is the reason for our non-profit status. To make our priorities known and attract the kind of like-minded parties who seek to participate for the right reasons. 
  
*(ending notes totally need work, but would be great if you could find a way to loop back in the non-profit status and how it helps Turing achieve its goals, attract the right partners, provide transparency to students, pay teachers competitive salaries, yada, yada, yada).*

You may have seen that Turing is organized as a non-profit, expecting approval
as a 501(c)(3) from the IRS within the next 10 months. I frequently then get the
question *"how's that working out for you?"* And the answer is *"it's difficult."*
The paperwork, the accountability, not qualifying for things like SBA loans, etc.
Yes, I'm familiar with "B Corps", but they're not the same.

A big part of the 501(c)(3) decision was about investment -- **I'm against it**. I
bootstrapped [Jumpstart Lab](http://jumpstartlab.com) in 2009, so doing the same
with Turing just made sense. But if you look around you'll find developer education
programs taking investment left and right, some in the tens of millions of dollars.

That's a *big problem*. Investors don't give money away, *they expect it back*.
And in the tech world, they're looking for 10x return on investment. If they put
in 18 million dollars they're shooting for a payout of 180 million.

If you're running a software or content business, that works. Khan Academy or
Coursera can parlay investment dollars into new content that can reach millions
of learners -- that's awesome. If they're each willing to pay a few dollars then
the investors can hit their 10x no problem while realizing the educational goals.

But we're not in the content business, we're in a services business. Classrooms
don't scale in the same ways as software and content.

So where can 10x returns come from? **Student tuition**. For every dollar an investor puts
in they want *ten student dollars back*. That tuition paid into the system, instead
of paying for their instructors and facilities, pays investors. It compels the school to
raise tuition and cut costs. You raise your student/teacher ratio and use less
experienced instructors. Money sucked out of the ecosystem, diverted to the investors.

**What's right for investors is orthogonal to what's right for students**. If we claim
to be focused on the best possible outcomes for our students *and* take investment, then 
we're lying to one side or another. And the side with the "little guy" will lose.

Is it hard to bootstrap while watching competitors take on huge investments? Of
course. But this is too important. I've made compromises on my beliefs in the past,
and I paid a huge price. It won't happen again. This is our chance to do it right.

And no outsider, regardless of how deep their pockets, will call the shots.
